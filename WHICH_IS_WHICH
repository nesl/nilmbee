To setup the whole system, you need the following things:

1) The sensors.
Refer to hw and sw/firmware*. 
sw/firmware is a node firmware that can detect current changes.
sw/firmware-binary is the firmware that detect only binary events. This one is used in my work.

2) The basestation hardware.
Refer to sw/mbed-basestation
There you can find a link to my mbed code, and a photo about how to setup the receiver. 

3) Basestation logger on the PC.
Refer to sw/pc/dumpdata2.py
It dumps all received data to stdout as well as log/log-sensor.txt, in a format that is used everywhere:
timestamp   sensor_id   group_id   slot_id   seq   event

3) Panel meter logger
Main program is not included in the repo. Go download CSocket.zip on internal wiki.
There is a script I used to collect the data. Refer to sw/pc/panel-meter-script

4) Gumstix for ground truth
Refer to sw/pc/wattsup/gumstix
Archive is the old code by Han Zhao. I'm using a simpler version that just store everything to a mysql server.
wattsup_http.conf is the config file. Run wattsup_http.py on gumstix. 

5) Ground truth php server
Refer to sw/pc/wattsup/web
The mysql structure is in a .sql file. 
log.php is for Gumstixs to upload logs. 
query.php is for downloading groundtruth for a single device for a certain period of time.
status.php is for monitoring the data rates. 

6) Downloading ground truth
Each dataset should contain the following file:
kw-sep.log, time.log, log-sensor.txt
When these files are available, run sw/pc/wattsup/web/powertruth.sh from the logging directory
It will automatically create a truth/ directory and pull the ground truth from the web server in 5).
