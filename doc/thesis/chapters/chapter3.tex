\chapter{Hardware design of a low-cost sensor node}\label{chap3}

We design our own sensors for event detection. The sensor plugs in an AC outlet, and provides one AC outlet for the appliance, and communicates with a base station. Each appliance in question should connect to a separate sensor directly. In order to make it affordable for large scale deployment, we need to make low-cost a primary design goal. We achieve the goal not by choosing cheap components, but by simplifying the requirements for sensor hardware. The extremely low price is inherent in the simplicity.

The functions and design goals of the sensor nodes are
\begin{itemize}
  \item Able to detect binary binary on-off state changes (events).
  \item Able to reliably deliver detected events to a central node.
  \item Affordable for large-scale deployment.
\end{itemize}

The hardware block diagram of the sensor is displayed in Fig.\ref{fig:hwoverview}. A photo of our prototype sensor is displayed in Fig.\ref{fig:sensor}.

\section{Binary power state sensing}

As discussed before, one of the function of the sensor is to detect binary (on-off) state changes. An appliance is off when it is in the lowest possible standby mode, and it is on when it is in any power mode higher than the off mode. We found that a simple threshold on power can achieve the job. Typically, in order to get power, both voltage and current need to be sampled, multiplied and accumulated. The power calculation is usually done in a separate metering chip, or as a dedicated hardware module integrated in a microcontroller. In our design, we decide to sample the current only, and detect state changes solely based on thresholding current. Although there is not enough information to obtain the actual power consumption from the electrical current, our experiments show that it is good enough to determine on-off events. In this way, the circuitry can be simpler without the voltage sampling channel and the dedicated metering chip or module. 

A $1m\Omega$ resistor in series with the appliance captures the instantaneous current flow. The voltage drop across the resistor is amplified 100 times by two stages of amplifier. An ATTiny10 microcontroller then samples the signal at approximately 1.6kHz, and run the event detection algorithm. 

The event detection algorithm run on the microcontroller is illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:eventdetect}. First, the range (i.e. max-min) of instantaneous current samples is taken for each 200-sample window. Note that the range does not necessarily represent the peak-peak amplitude of the electrical current due to clippings (discussed later). Nevertheless, the range does capture enough information for on-off state detection. We take a threshold and get an instantaneous binary state for each window. The threshold is adjusted slightly based on the state of the appliance, so that the binarization has some hysteresis. 

\begin{figure}[htb]

\end{figure}

The threshold is hardcoded in the microcontroller firmware, and it is set to around 5W (not precise because of the uncalibrated pre-amplifier). Appliances with dry-contact switch, such as lamps and electric fans, draw absolutely zero power when turned off. Other appliances with soft-controlled switch, such as microwave and computer monitors, draw a very low standby power when turned off. Our experiments show that 5W is a reasonable threshold for most appliances. 

The 200-sample window in which the range of samples is taken and binarized is about 12ms, or about 7 AC cycles long. The length is short, to ensure quick response to state changes. However, the instantaneous state is too sensitive and bouncing. Therefore, we employ a debouncing counter that counts up to 16. Then appliance state is changed only if 16 successive windows all show the opposite instantaneous state. 

As mentioned before, the range of samples in each window does not necessarily represent the peak-peak amplitude of the electrical current. The reason is as following. Both the amplifier and the ADC are powered with a single positive DC power. Ideally, the negative half of the AC signals will be clipped in all stages of amplification and AD conversion. In the real circuit, some Op-Amps we use may have negative input bias voltage up to -4mV. To compensate it, we use a $2.4M\Omega$ pull-up resistor to bias the input signal. 

Although the analog front-end is not designed to reduce noise and best preserve the signal, it performs well enough in detecting binary states. 

\section{Simplex radio}

The sensor should be able to transmit detected events to a central base station with no additional wiring. There are several technologies for networking sensor nodes in short ranges. For instance, IEEE 802.15.4 is a standard for short range radio communication, and is widely used in sensor networking. Proprietary wireless sensor network technologies are also available such as ANT radio and TI sub-GHz radio. On the other hand, communication is also possible through the AC power lines, namely Power-line Communication (PLC). The most popular PLC technology for home automation is X10, despite its low bitrate. 

We do not use the most popular wireless sensor network radio technologies such as 802.15.4. These radio technologies usually provide several hundred kBps or even several MBps of duplex link, with sophisticated packeting and MAC, etc. These radio ICs are a few dollars each. In order to control the radio chip, microcontroller needs to have SPI or other serial link, which further pushes up the requirement of the microcontroller, as well as the price. However, in our case, appliances usually generate events once per several minutes, or even hours. And a state changing event is literally one bit of data, plus the ID of sensor and few control bits. 

Low rate PLC technology is suitable for our application. However, it is not low-cost, and has other problems inherently. To couple signals onto the power lines, PLC transmitter needs coils which are costly and big in physical size. Non-linear appliances can interfere the transmission on the power lines, making the channel even worth than wireless channels. Moreover, devices on different circuit branches can not communicate without a bridge device. 

Considering our requirements, we decide to use a bare-bone 315MHz ASK transmitter. The transmitter module is basically an oscillator, with one digital gate pin. To reliably utilize the radio module, we design a coding scheme (details in Appendix \ref{app1}). And because it is transmit-only, to improve reliability, we designed a retransmission scheme, which will be discussed in detail in Chapter \ref{chap4}. 

\section{DC Power supply}

The sensor draws power from AC power lines with a voltage-drop-capacitor DC power supply. This is a DC supply topology with very compact design and low cost, suitable for low current DC requirements. The supply voltage of the circuit is 3.6V DC with the neutral line as reference voltage. The current is 3mA when standby, 15mA when transmitting. 

We also have zero-crossing detection capability on our circuit, which is used for synchronization and timing purposes. 

\section{Cost and scalability}

There are several design decisions that ensures the sensor to be inexpensive inherently. By sensing the current only, instead of power, we eliminate the need for a meter IC or a microcontroller with meter module. Because only binary output is needed, distortion and clippings are tolerable. Thus, we do not need to calibrate the analog frontend. By employing a simple RF module, we eliminate the need for an RF IC or a microcontroller with SPI or other interfaces. 

Without the need for any peripherals other one analog input and two digital GPIOs, we are able to use the simplest microcontrollers. The microcontroller we use in our design is ATtiny10, which has only 6 pins, 1024 bytes of program memory. Moreover, the functions of the microcontroller are 1) taking threshold and smooth it, and 2) toggle a pin for RF transmission. The first can be done with pure analog circuitry, while the latter can be replaced by a sequence generator circuitry. Hence, it is even possible to replace the microcontroller with a very simple customized IC, which is more cost-effective at large quantity. 

We reuse the plastic packaging of a commercial plug-load timer to make our prototype sensors, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:sensor}. Therefore, the physical size is limited by the packaging. In fact, the circuit board can be made much smaller. It is even possible to embed the circuitry in every plug or every outlet. The cost of all electronics components of our prototype board is 2.3 dollars each at a quantity of 1000. Including PCB, assembly and packaging, the overall cost should be as low as 4.3 US dollars. It is totally affordable to have one sensor for each appliance, considering that appliances themselves are usually tens or hundreds of dollars.
