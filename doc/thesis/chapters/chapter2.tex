Direct sensing, i.e. metering at every appliances, is an accurate approach to energy disaggregation, yet a costly one. Commercial products range from low-end LCD display meters (e.g. Kill-A-Watt) that cost around 20 dollars to high-end networked meters (e.g. Watts up? PRO) that cost around 200 dollars. There are also great research platforms such as ACme \cite{Jiang2009} that can meter and wirelessly transmit energy data. However, their 60-dollar cost still makes it unaffordable for large deployment other than research purposes. 

In recent year, a lot of research work has focused on the other extreme of solutions: NILM, i.e. having no sub-meters, and putting all the intelligence in a central meter. 

NILM, or most of energy disaggregation methods without direct metering, have generally three phases: 1) power state change detection, i.e. detecting that one or more appliances' power consumption has changed. For most appliances, a change in its power consumption means a change in its power state. For example, a microwave oven goes from off to on, or a electric fan goes from high speed to low speed. There are also some appliances that do not have discrete power states, such as a battery charger, whose consumption varies continuously during the charging cycle, or a computer, whose consumption varies with different workload. 2) Appliance identification, i.e. identify which appliance has a state change. This is done with the help of some prior knowledge about each appliances interested. In some NILM algorithms, this phase is done together with the first phase. 3) Estimation of energy numbers for each appliances, i.e. keeping track of disaggregated power of each appliances, with the knowledge of which appliance has caused which power state changes.

The methods of NILM can be generally classified into two categories. Some methods analysis  steady states, such as apparent power, real power (P), reactive power (Q), power factor (PF), etc. These values are usually obtained at a low sampling frequency, typically less than 1Hz. However, some steady states also need high frequency sampling, for example higher harmonic of current trace or power trace. 

The original NILM method \cite{Hart1992} falls in this category, step changes in aggregated real and reactive power (P and Q) are detected and clustered, so that similar changes are identified to be caused by the same appliance. This method faces the limitation that some appliances have very similar signature on the P-Q plane. Moreover, for non-linear appliances, the reactive power is not linear, meaning that the change in reactive power monitored at central meter is not the change of reactive power of the appliance. Other algorithms such as genetic algorithm and dynamic programming has also been used \cite{Baranski2004,Baranski2004a}. 
Some work also exploits higher harmonics in the steady state power measurements \cite{Laughman2003}. This adds some new signatures to differentiate appliances. 
In order to reduce the number of appliances that need to be distinguished, researchers also tried pushing the meters down to subcircuit level \cite{Marchiori2011}. This will help because some of the large appliances are placed on separate circuits. 

On the other hand, some NILM methods identify appliances by their transient signatures when power states change \cite{Leeb1995,Cox2006}. For example, appliances with motors (e.g. refrigerators) usually produce a large spike when turned on, due to the inductive coils. The drawback is that transient signatures are hard to detect when multiple events happens together \cite{Leeb1995}. Recent research uses the Hidden Markov Model to model the power consumption of a power cycle of appliances \cite{Kolter2012}. Therefore, the model captures both transient signatures at the starting period and also the expected length of a power cycle. 

Although current NILM methods work well in certain circumstances, such as with high power consumption appliances, they still have some limitations. The most challenging problem with NILM is that when the number of appliances increases, 1) it is more likely to have appliances with similar signatures; 2) it is more likely to have overlapping events. Due to these limitations, current NILM systems can hardly work with more than ten appliances. 
To push up the limitation on the number of appliances, researchers developed a type of hybrid methods. These methods try to augment the central inferencing algorithm with some additional data collected from distributed sensors. These sensor data can hopefully dramatically improve the accuracy or scalability of the system, without raising the cost too much. 

ViridiScape \cite{Kim2009a} uses several kinds of sensor, such as light, sound and magnetometers, to tell the on-off states of appliances (assuming all appliances have binary states). With the knowledge of the states of all appliances and the aggregated power readings over time, it is able to run a linear programming to calibrate how much power each appliance use. In another related work \cite{Jung2010}, people are able to automatically identify where to install sub-meters in order to achieve satisfiable disaggregation accuracy. It assumes availability of reliable on-off state information of all appliances. 

In this paper, we presents a very low cost sensor network that can deliver reliable on-off state information of appliances, thus improving the accuracy and scalability of energy disaggregation systems. Our design shows that it is possible to lower the cost of the system by reducing the capability of each single node, yet preserve high reliability and provide crucial information that helps the energy disaggregation algorithms.
